abstract: Disseminated cryptococcosis has a nearly 70% mortality, mostly attributed to CNS infection, with lesser-known effects on other organs. Immune protection against Cryptococcus relies on Th1 immunity with M1 polarization, rendering macrophages fungicidal. The importance of M1-upregulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) has been documented in pulmonary anticryptococcal defenses, whereas its role in disseminated cryptococcosis remains controversial. Here we examined the effect of iNOS deletion in disseminated (i.v.) C. deneoformans 52D infection, comparing wild-type (C57BL/6J) and iNOS−/− mice. iNOS−/− mice had significantly reduced survival and nearly 100-fold increase of the kidney fungal burden, without increases in the lungs, spleen, or brain. Histology revealed extensive lesions and almost complete destruction of the kidney cortical area with a loss of kidney function. The lack of fungal control was not due to a failure to recruit immune cells because iNOS−/− mice had increased kidney leukocytes. iNOS−/− mice also showed no defect in T cell polarization. We conclude that iNOS is critically required for local anticryptococcal defenses in the kidneys, whereas it appears to be dispensable in other organs during disseminated infection. This study exemplifies a unique phenotype of local immune defenses in the kidneys and the organ-specific importance of a single fungicidal pathway..
